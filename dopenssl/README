Presentation
============

The dOpenSSL library extends the OpenSSL cryptographic library by providing
deterministic random generation functionalities which can be used for
rotating and deriving cryptographic keys.

Indeed, the OpenSSL random generator introduces entropy in many places,
making it unusable in a deterministic way. Thus, some functions have been
cloned and adapted in order to guarantee determinism whenever necessary.

Dependencies
============

The library relies upon several other libraries:

  o OpenSSL which provides the fundamental cryptographic operations.

Internals
=========

The library is composed of a three components, all required for ensuring the
determinism of the cryptography key generation mechanism.

First, a deterministic random implementation is provided, referred to as dRAND.

Although this implementation is deterministic, determinism must also be assured
at the BIGNUM level because some of the functions introduce entroy, the ones
related to BN_generate_prime_ex() for instance.

Finally a set of functions for deducing a private/public key from a PRNG seed in
a deterministic way is provided for every asymmetric cryptosystem, such as RSA.

In other words, some of the OpenSSL library's functions have been slightly
modified so as to remove the operations destined at adding entropy, especially the
ones based on uninitialized variables.

The reader interested in looking at these slight modifications can look around for
"PATCHED".
