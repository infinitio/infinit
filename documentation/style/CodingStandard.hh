/*
 * The three files CodingStandard.{cc, hh, hxx} along with fwd.hh and
 * SomeInterface.hh describe the coding style used throughout the Infinit
 * project which every developer must comply to.
 *
 * Among the core rules are:
 *
 *   o Never use tabulations, always prefer spaces for both indentation
 *     and alignment.
 *   o Never exceed 80 columns: lines must be broken if necessary.
 *   o Everything must be written in English, properly using cases.
 *   o Space out the code as much as possible so as to make it breathe.
 *   o Use // for in-code comments and /// for the generated documentation
 *     i.e Doxygen. As such the class description, method descriptions,
 *     global variable descriptions etc. are considered documentation.
 *   o XXX must be included in comments in order to specify something which
 *     needs completing or re-working. Note that should the modification be
 *     important, one would have to open a ticket instead.
 *
 * All comments used for explaining the coding standards are written in
 * C-style -- i.e including this comment -- so as to be distinguishable
 * from the rest.
 *
 * The overall naming convention can be summarized as:
 *   o Types: upper CamelCase
 *   o Values (attributes, variables, enums etc.): lowercase
 */

 * A single space must follow macros such as ifndef, define etc., no matter
 * their position.

 *
 * Additionally, as one can notice, the macros and macro-functions do
 * not need to be placed in the namespaces since independent from
 * the language used.
