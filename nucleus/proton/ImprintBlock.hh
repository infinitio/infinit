    /// The idea behind this construct is very similar to public key blocks
    /// with the address being computed by applying a one-way function on
    /// the block's public key except that in this case, as for owner key
    /// blocks, the owner's public key is used as the block's public key. Thus
    /// the block's signature can be generated with the owner's private key
    /// instead of the block's private key. The result is that the user does
    /// not need to keep the private key of every created object as it is for
    /// public key blocks. Instead, the owner only keeps his personal key pair
    /// which which he created and sign imprint blocks.
