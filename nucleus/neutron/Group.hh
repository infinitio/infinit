    /// A group represents a set of users and subgroups. Groups are used
    /// mainly to ease the process of managing accesses on files and
    /// directories by grouping entities (users for instance) together.
    ///
    /// Every group is associated with a pass which is a cryptographic key
    /// pair. While the public key of the pass is made available to everyone,
    /// the private part is distributed to every member of the group (known
    /// as fellow) through a token i.e by encrypting it with the fellow's
    /// public key so that only he can decrypt it.
    ///
    /// Whenever an object (file/directory/link) owner wishes to grant access
    /// to a group, the object secret key (with which the data have been
    /// encrypted) is encrypted with the group's public pass into a token.
    /// This token is stored in the object's Access block in the record
    /// associated with the group identity. Should a group fellow want to
    /// access the object's content, he would first decrypt his token
    /// so as to have access to the group's private pass. Then, with this
    /// private pass, he would decrypt the token contained in the Access
    /// block so as to reveal the object's secret key. Finally, the object's
    /// content could be accessed.
    ///
    /// Since the composition of the group changes over time, a fellow is
    /// removed from the group for instance, the past users must not have
    /// access to the new passes (though having access to the passes they
    /// already had access to is not a weakness of the security mechanism).
    /// For that purpose, whenever the group manager (i.e owner/creator)
    /// modifies the composition, a new pass is generated i.e the public
    /// pass is updated and the fellows' tokens are re-generated.
    ///
    /// XXX[note that a new pass must be generated only when a fellow is
    ///     removed. otherwise, there is not security threat in keeping the
    ///     same pass for new fellows]
