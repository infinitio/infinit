Presentation
============

The infinit cryptography library provides a set of functions and abstractions
for performing high-level cryptographic operations on buffers (i.e this library
is not stream-oriented).

Dependencies
============

The library relies upon several other libraries:

  o OpenSSL which provides the fundamental cryptographic operations.
  o Elle which provides basic types and the serialization mechanism enabling
    one to perform cryptograhic operations on any serializable type.
  o Comet which extends OpenSSL so as to provide deterministic pseudo-random
    generation.

Environment variables
=====================

These variables can be used to parameter the library:

  o INFINIT_CRYPTOGRAPHY_RANDOM_SOURCE defines the path to the source file
    from which data will be read in order to initialize the random generator.
    The default value for this variable is: "/dev/random"
