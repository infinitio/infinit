Presentation
============

The comet library extends the OpenSSL cryptographic library by providing
deterministic random generation functionalities which can be used for
rotating and deriving cryptographic keys.

Indeed, the OpenSSL random generator introduces entropy in many places,
making it unusable in a deterministic way. Thus, some functions have been
cloned and adapted in order to guarantee determinism whenever necessary.

Dependencies
============

The library relies upon several other libraries:

  o OpenSSL which provides the fundamental cryptographic operations.

Internals
=========

The library is composed of a random implementation which is deterministic.
Then comes the big number set of functions which make sure the prime generation
mechanism does not introduce entropy. Finally a set of rotate/derive functions
is provided for every asymmetric cryptosystem, such as RSA, enabling one to
retrieve a key pair based on a PRNG seed.
