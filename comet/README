Presentation
============

The comet library extends the OpenSSL cryptographic library by providing
deterministic random generation functionalities which can be used for
rotating and deriving cryptographic keys.

Indeed, the OpenSSL random generator introduces entropy in many places,
making it unusable in a deterministic way. Thus, some functions have been
cloned and adapted in order to guarantee determinism whenever necessary.

Dependencies
============

The library relies upon several other libraries:

  o OpenSSL which provides the fundamental cryptographic operations.
